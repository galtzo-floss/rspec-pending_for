## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-pending_for'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-pending_for

## Usage

The gem auto-configures itself for use in your Rspec suite.  Just add this line to yous `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'rspec/pending_for'
```

To mark a spec pending for a specific ruby engine, and/or versions:

```ruby
it("blah is blah") do
  pending_for(engine: "ruby", version: "2.1.5")
  expect("blah").to eq "blah"
end
```

To skip a spec for a specific ruby engine, and/or versions:

```ruby
it("blah is blah") do
  skip_for(engine: "ruby", version: "2.1.5")
  expect("blah").to eq "blah"
end
```

To mark a spec pending for all versions of a given engine:

```ruby
it("blah is blah") do
  pending_for(engine: "jruby")
  expect("blah").to eq "blah"
end
```

To mark a spec pending for a custom reason (overriding the default message):

```ruby
it("blah is blah") do
  pending_for(engine: "jruby", reason: "This does not work on JRuby")
  expect("blah").to eq "blah"
end
```

To mark a spec pending or skipped for multiple engines and versions, just what you would expect:

```ruby
it("blah is blah") do
  skip_for(engine: "jruby", reason: "This does not work on JRuby so skipping for now") # All JRuby versions will be skipped
  pending_for(engine: "rbx", reason: "This does not work on Rubinius so pending for now") # All rbx versions will be pending
  pending_for(engine: "ruby", versions:%w(1.9.3 2.0.0 2.1.0)) # uses the default message
  expect("blah").to eq "blah"
end
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically,
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will
only be introduced with new major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a
dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'rspec-pending_for', '~> 1.1'
